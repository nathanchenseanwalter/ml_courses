Predicting Undergraduate Dropout

Wonjoon Choi, Nathaniel Chen

The United States experiences 40% college dropout rate every year. With only 41% of
students graduating after four years without delay (ThinkImpact, 2021). Educational failure, such
as dropping out of school, is a major social issue that impacts the whole society. On the
individual level, people with only a high school degree are approximately three times more likely
to live in poverty when compared to people with a bachelorâ€™s degree (EDI, 2021). And on the
societal level, a lower education level can lead to problems with economic growth, employment,
and productivity. Thus, it is important to prevent or aid students in need ahead of time so that
endangered students can make their way to graduation.

We would like to present a potential solution to this problem. Depending on the traits of a
student, we want to present the numerical value of how likely a student is to drop out of school.
So that higher numerical value would indicate the student is at a greater risk of dropping out. To
achieve this, we found a dataset collected from the Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre. The data
set includes over 25 traits of students and their enrollment status. First, we would like to find out
which traits of a student is a better predictors of dropping out. Second, we would like to present
a numerical value of how likely a student is to drop out. And lastly, we want to try out different
machine learning models with their variations to find out the best-predicting model for this
problem. If our investigation and ML model turns out to be successful, hopefully, we wish to
expand our study to the UCLA community.
